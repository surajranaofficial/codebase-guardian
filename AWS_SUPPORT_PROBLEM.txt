DETAILED PROBLEM EXPLANATION FOR AWS SUPPORT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM:
I cannot access Amazon Bedrock Claude 3 Haiku model despite having $220 
in AWS credits, including $100 specifically for "AWS AI Agent Hackathon".

WHAT HAPPENS:
1. I try to invoke Bedrock model via API
2. Get error: "AccessDeniedException: Model access is denied due to 
   INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT"
3. AWS Marketplace creates subscription agreement for Claude 3 Haiku
4. Agreement EXPIRES IMMEDIATELY (start time = end time)
5. I receive email showing agreement expired at creation
6. This repeats every time I try

EMAIL EVIDENCE:
- Agreement 1: Start 07:27 AM UTC, End 07:27 AM UTC (0 seconds duration!)
- Agreement 2: Start 07:53 AM UTC, End 07:54 AM UTC (1 minute only)
- Pattern repeats with each attempt

WHAT I'VE TRIED:
✅ Added payment method (credit/debit card)
✅ Card is valid and works elsewhere
✅ Waited 2+ hours for verification
✅ Multiple access attempts
✅ Verified $220 credits available

ROOT CAUSE:
- Payment method validation is FAILING
- This causes Marketplace agreements to expire instantly
- Credits cannot be used because payment check fails FIRST
- Catch-22: Have credits but can't use them

WHY THIS IS URGENT:
- AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon participant
- Have $100 credits specifically for this hackathon
- Project fully deployed on AWS (Lambda + API Gateway working)
- ONLY need Bedrock access to complete demo
- Hackathon deadline approaching
- Will only use ~$5-10 (well within $100 credit)

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Account ID: 823915211349
- Service: Amazon Bedrock
- Model: anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0
- Region: ap-south-1
- Credits: $220 total
  * AWS AI Agent Hackathon - 4th cohort: $100 (exp 11/30/2025)
  * AWS Free Tier: $100 (exp 10/14/2026)
  * Explore AWS Lambda: $20 (exp 10/14/2026)
- Credits used: $0.00

WHAT I NEED:
Can you please:
1. Manually enable Bedrock access using my existing credits?
2. Override/bypass payment validation requirement?
3. Manually activate Claude 3 Haiku Marketplace subscription?
4. Provide workaround to use hackathon credits for Bedrock?

The credits were provided specifically for this hackathon project, but 
payment validation is preventing me from using them.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- AWS Lambda Python 3.9 application
- API Gateway endpoint deployed
- IAM role with AmazonBedrockFullAccess
- Error occurs at: boto3 bedrock-runtime.invoke_model() call
- Lambda & API Gateway working perfectly
- Only Bedrock API call fails

SUMMARY:
Payment validation blocking use of $100 hackathon credits for Bedrock. 
Marketplace agreements expire immediately upon creation. Need manual 
intervention to enable Bedrock using existing credits for time-sensitive 
hackathon project.

Thank you for urgent assistance!
