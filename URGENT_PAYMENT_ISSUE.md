# üö® URGENT: Payment Issue Diagnosis

## Problem: Marketplace Agreements Expiring Immediately

### Email Evidence:
```
Agreement 1:
- Start: 07:27 AM UTC
- End:   07:27 AM UTC (SAME TIME!)

Agreement 2:
- Start: 07:53 AM UTC  
- End:   07:54 AM UTC (1 minute!)
```

### Root Cause:
**INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT causing immediate agreement expiration**

This is NOT a "wait for verification" issue.
This is an ACTIVE PAYMENT FAILURE.

### What's Happening:
1. You try to access Bedrock
2. AWS creates Marketplace agreement for Claude
3. Payment validation runs immediately
4. Payment FAILS validation
5. Agreement expires instantly
6. Loop repeats with each attempt

### Why It's Serious:
- Normal: Payment verification takes hours but succeeds
- Your case: Payment ACTIVELY FAILING every time
- Means: Card is being declined/rejected, not just pending

### Possible Causes:
1. ‚ùå Card declined by issuing bank
2. ‚ùå International transactions blocked
3. ‚ùå Card type not supported for AWS Marketplace
4. ‚ùå Insufficient funds/limits
5. ‚ùå Bank blocking AWS/Marketplace charges
6. ‚ùå Previous failed attempts triggered fraud alert

### Immediate Actions:

#### Option 1: Try Different Card (FASTEST)
- Remove current payment method
- Add completely different card:
  - Different bank
  - Different card type
  - International-enabled
  - Virtual credit card (Privacy.com)
- Wait 15-30 mins for new verification

#### Option 2: Contact Bank (2-4 HOURS)
Call your bank immediately:
```
"Please authorize AWS Marketplace charges
Merchant: Amazon Web Services / AWS Marketplace  
Type: Recurring subscription
Amount: ~$1-10 authorization
Allow international if needed
I'm getting declined repeatedly"
```

#### Option 3: AWS Support (HOURS TO DAYS)
Create urgent support case:
```
Priority: Urgent
Category: Billing/Payment
Subject: Marketplace agreements expiring immediately - INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT

Message:
"Payment method added but Claude 3 Haiku Marketplace agreements 
expire within seconds (start=end time). Account 823915211349.
Need immediate help for time-sensitive hackathon project.
Can you provide temporary credits or alternative access?"
```

### Timeline Reality:
- **Best case:** Different card works in 30 mins
- **Typical:** 2-4 hours with bank authorization
- **Worst case:** 24-48 hours or multiple days

### Critical Decision:

**IF HACKATHON DEADLINE IS SOON (next 24-48 hours):**
