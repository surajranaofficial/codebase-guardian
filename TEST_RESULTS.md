# Codebase Guardian - Test Results

## ✅ Test 1: Basic Functionality (PASSED)

**Test Date:** October 18, 2025

**API Endpoint:** `https://w88pf50xy2.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/webhook/`

**Status:** API is deployed and responding correctly

### Test Case: Simple Code Review

**Input:**
```python
def get_greeting(name):
-    return "Hello " + name
+    if name:
+        return "Hello " + name
+    return "Hello there"
```

**Response Status:** 200 OK

**AI Review Output:**
```
The provided code diff introduces a change to the `get_greeting` function. Here's my review:

### Positive:
- The change adds a check for the `name` parameter, ensuring that the function returns a greeting even if no name is provided.

### Potential Improvements:
- Consider using f-strings (formatted string literals) instead of string concatenation
- Handle the case where `name` is an empty string or contains only whitespace characters

Overall, the code changes look good and address a potential issue where an empty string could be passed as the `name` parameter.
```

**Result:** ✅ Agent successfully reviewed code and provided constructive feedback

## ✅ Test 2: Security Vulnerability Detection (PASSED)

**Test Case:** SQL Injection Detection

**Input:**
```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
-    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='" + username + "'"
+    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'"
```

**AI Review:**
- ✅ Detected security improvement (password parameter added)
- ✅ Suggested password hashing and salting
- ✅ Recommended input validation to prevent injection attacks
- ✅ Suggested error handling improvements

**Result:** Agent correctly identified security considerations and provided actionable recommendations.

## ✅ Test 3: Performance Optimization Review (PASSED)

**Test Case:** List Comprehension vs Loop

**Input:**
```python
def process_data(items):
-    for i in range(len(items)):
-        result.append(items[i] * 2)
+    result = [item * 2 for item in items]
```

**AI Review:**
- ✅ Recognized performance improvement
- ✅ Noted improved readability
- ✅ Suggested better function naming
- ✅ Explained benefits of list comprehension

**Result:** Agent validated the optimization and provided additional best practice suggestions.

## ✅ Test 4: Error Handling Best Practices (PASSED)

**Test Case:** Adding try-catch and validation

**Input:**
```python
def handle_request(data):
+    try:
+        user = data.get('user')
+        if not user or not email:
+            return {"error": "Missing required fields"}
+    except Exception as e:
+        return {"error": str(e)}
```

**AI Review:**
- ✅ Praised error handling addition
- ✅ Validated input validation approach
- ✅ Appreciated clear error messages
- ✅ Confirmed robustness improvements

**Result:** Agent correctly identified code quality improvements.
